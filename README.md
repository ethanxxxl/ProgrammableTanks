# Programmable Tanks!!!
  This is a fun little project that I am using to 2D graphics, physics engines,
and C programming.

  The goal of this project is to create a 2D tank game, where tanks are able to
be controlled via scripts.

## Goals for this project are

  - An interface for scripting the tanks.
  - "3D" projectiles.
  - Multiplayer
